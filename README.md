To successfully run the code you will need to make sure that you have the following packages installed:tidyverse,ggplot2, scales,forcats, svglite, viridis, gtExtras,
gridExtra, DiagrammeR, DiagrammeRsvg,and rsvg.
Afterwards you can just run the code directly and it will display the output apart from the flowchart(the first visualization) which you will be able to only see once
you render the file into its HTML format.
